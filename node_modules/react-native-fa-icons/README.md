# react-native-fa-icons

[![NPM](https://nodei.co/npm/react-native-fa-icons.png)](https://npmjs.org/package/react-native-fa-icons)


Font Awesome Icons for React Native. Inspired from [react-native-fontawesome](https://github.com/entria/react-native-fontawesome). This module uses Font Awesome latest version [4.7.0](http://fontawesome.io/assets/font-awesome-4.7.0.zip).


# Benefits
- No bloatware, one package with one iconset, nothing more nothing less
- Full set of FontAwesome Icons properly updated
- Insanely fast with minimal memory footprint
- Uses the OS to render icons, for best in class performance (refer to performance note bellow)


# Installation

### Using npm
`npm i --save react-native-fa-icons`

### Using yarn

`yarn add react-native-fa-icons`

# Adding Font File

### Automatically

`react-native link react-native-fa-icons`

**Note:** There is no Java/ObjectiveC/swift binaries added using this command, it simply adds the font file to your android and ios projects.

# Usage
```javascript
import Icon from 'react-native-fa-icons';

<Icon name="address-book" style={{ fontSize: 45, color: 'green' }} />
```

# Props
| prop | required | type | description |
| ---- | ---- | ----| ---- |
| name | Yes | string | Icon name from [here](http://fontawesome.io/icons/). |

All props supported by react-native `Text` are also supported by `ÃŒcon`. See: https://facebook.github.io/react-native/docs/text#props


# Why this is fast, and uses almost no extra memory
This package uses the Text element to render Icons. The Text element delegates
to the OS the render process of the icons based on the Font file.
Both IOS and Android render fonts amazingly fast with little memory overhead. In essence  
FontAwesome.ttf will be used by the OS to render icons and will benefit of years
of native software improvement as well hardware acceleration.
